Description: This repo actually has nothing to do with React, but rather is a
 base class meant for pairing up with JS based front-end UI components (see
 https://github.com/timbr-io/jupyter-react-js). The only thing in this module
 is a "Component" class. This class can be created with a "module" name that
 matches the name of a JS UI component and opens up a line of commuination
 called an "IPython Comm". Using the comm messages can be pased back and forth
 and property and actions can be taken as a result of UI interaction.
