Description: Python‐based simulations of chemistry framework (PySCF) is a
 general‐purpose electronic structure platform designed from the ground up to
 emphasize code simplicity, so as to facilitate new method development and
 enable flexible computational workflows. The package provides a wide range of
 tools to support simulations of finite‐size systems, extended systems with
 periodic boundary conditions, low‐dimensional periodic systems, and custom
 Hamiltonians, using mean‐field and post‐mean‐field methods with standard
 Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the
 Python language to implement almost all of its features, while
 computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C
 routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as
 efficient as the best existing C or Fortran‐based quantum chemistry programs.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
